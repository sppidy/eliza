## The Normal Way
Simply clone the repository and run the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lakshya-man05/eliza
cd eliza
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m userbot
```
An example `local_config.py` file could be:
**Not All of the variables are mandatory**
__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__
```python3
from heroku_config import Var
class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
```
### eliza Configuration
The eliza Config is situated in `userbot/elizaConfig.py`.
**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.
**Local Configuration**
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the eliza Support Config.
## Mandatory Vars
- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
